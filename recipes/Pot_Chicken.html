        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Instant Pot chicken and dumplings recipe provides the richness of a long-simmered chicken stew without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This compromise — using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast — gave me the richness of flavor and ease of preparation I was looking for. It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven.</p>
