        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This cheesy pull apart garlic bread is easy to make with store-bought bread dough and flavored with lots of fresh herbs and garlic.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>cooking spray</li>
          <li>1 stick salted butter, softened</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped herbs, such as basil and/or parsley</li>
          <li>2 (11-oz package) refrigerated French bread loaf dough</li>
          <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C). Lightly coat an 8.5 to 9 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine butter, garlic, and herbs in a medium bowl and stir until well blended. Unroll 1 can of bread dough onto a flat surface. Spread half of butter mixture over the dough and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese and 1 cup of mozzarella. Cut the dough into 12 squares.  Repeat with remaining dough, butter, and cheeses. </p></li>
            <li><p>Stack the dough squares on top of each other and arrange them in the prepared baking dish.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through in the center, 40 to 50 minutes. If bread becomes too dark,  loosely cover with foil halfway through baking.</p></li>
            <li><p>Allow bread to cool about 5 minutes before removing the loaf to a serving tray.</p></li>
